= What is WP or WordPress import? =

It is a method to import your content from one WordPress database or instance to another using a plugin.

It allows you to copy all the existing posts, pages, and categories from an existing site into a new website. Our plugin can do this by using the WordPress database as a source of information on your old site. You can then move the content to another website or blog.

This means that when you import using our plugin, you'll be able to use all the same posts, pages, and categories that were already on your old site. You'll also have access to all the settings and options configured on your old site before shutting it down.

Our plugin has been around for 12 years now and it's still one of the most used plugins when it comes to importing content on WordPress sites. You can use this plugin to migrate your existing WordPress installation to a new one. Or even export content, and import or update your data in bulk.

= What are Import and Export in WordPress? =

Importing and exporting are two different things. WordPress can import data from other sources, but it cannot export the data to another source. It is possible to export a WordPress database using the wp_export_dump() function to back up your database tables in bulk. Other ways are using a plugin to export the data as XML, CSV, or JSON file formats.

If the webmaster is inconvenient with manual copying, then this is a welcome change. Instead of copying and pasting, simply drag and drop!

Importing content that is posts, pages, and attachments is an extremely useful tool for building out sites with content from other sources. You can use it as an alternative to building SEO structures within your website or adding new products or services to existing sites.

== FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

= What is a CSV file? =

CSV files or Comma Separated Value files are a simple text format for storing tabular data. A comma is used to separate characters and also used to separate values in tables. When a comma is used for separating characters within a CSV file, it should be escaped with double quotes for proper structuring values in tables.

= What is CSV file format? =

For WordPress, the default format will be UTF-8, and for non-Latin character data, UTF-8 without BOM is used. Various file formats are available based on encoding types like ANSI, UTF-8, UTF-8 without BOM, USC-2 BE BOM, and USC-2 LE BOM.

= How to validate a CSV file for issues? =

Importing your CSV may fail if you miss escaping characters or misplace/skip characters. Any CSV file should be checked for errors or warnings before being imported into WordPress. You can validate a CSV file using a free tool CSV Lint to identify issues and where to fix them exactly.

= What is an XML file? =

An XML document is a basic unit of XML information, consisting of elements and other markups in an orderly package. An XML document contains a wide variety of data.

= Can I get any demo data or sample files for testing the import? =

Get [example CSV files from here to start testing import](https://www.smackcoders.com/blog/wordpress-ultimate-csv-importer-csv-sample-files-and-updates.html?utm_source=web&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=wp_org) with WP Ultimate CSV Importer.

= Why can't I import all WordPress demo content? =

There may be 2 possible cases
1. The plugin supports zip uploads. There may be unsupported file types in the zip file, it should have XML or CSV files.
2. The uploaded XML or CSV file contains errors or is not properly validated.

= WordPress posts not showing after import, Why and how to fix this? =

This could rarely happen for reasons like,
1. Mandatory fields have no values.
2. wp_debug value is set to True.

You could avoid this error by providing values to the mandatory fields and setting False to wp_debug in the wp_config file.

= Why does the media library fail to import using the Export-Import WordPress plugin? That is not importing all images to WordPress media, no files found? =

The failure may be due to,
1. Unsupported image formats.
2. The image is not publicly downloadable (permission issue).
3. The domain or URL doesn't exist or isn't secured (SSL issues).

= How to import WordPress posts with images? =

To do this, add a separate column for featured images in your import file and mention the image URL as a value. Or declare the inline images inside the post_content and provide the image URL using the HTML tag inside the post_content.

= How to import all external images in WordPress? =

In the Media Handling section of the WordPress Importer plugin, just enable the **Download Post-Content External Images to Media** option.
